# TypeScript_API_boilerPlate
This repo contains a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) TypeScript NodeJS boilerplate API containerized using Docker. It has been modularized to allow easier readability as well matches production-ready code and tests, giving you a good starting point to understand how to build an API and what to expect in the industry.

The API has is based on a platform with user management it contains 6 different routes each shows a different HTTP method. It uses a Mock Data JSON (javascript object notation) document as our Database.
